**Status:** ðŸ§© In Progress

## ðŸ•“ Incident Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Action / Observation | Result / Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **2025-10-20 10:15** | Deployed updated static site files (HTML/CSS/JS) to Azure Storage. | Confirmed new files appear correctly in the storage container. |
| **2025-10-20 10:25** | Opened public website via custom domain. | Still displaying *old version* â€” HTML not refreshed. |
| **2025-10-20 10:40** | Tested direct blob URL (`https://<storage>.web.core.windows.net/index.html`). | âœ… New version loads correctly. Confirms CDN/Front Door caching. |
| **2025-10-20 11:00** | Used **Purge** under Azure Front Door > Caching > `/*`. | Waited 5 minutes â€” still loading old version. |
| **2025-10-20 11:30** | Cleared browser + tried Incognito and mobile 4G connection. | Issue persists â†’ not a local cache problem. |
| **2025-10-20 12:00** | Checked Rules Engine for existing cache rules. | No custom rule found; likely default 3-day TTL. |
| **2025-10-20 13:10** | Hypothesis: Missing `Cache-Control` header at origin (Blob). | Need to add explicit caching headers or disable caching for `.html`. |
| **2025-10-20 14:00** | Plan next test: disable AFD caching or add rule `Cache-Control: no-store` for `.html`. | Pending implementation. |

## ðŸ§  Summary (so far)

- Azure Front Door continues to serve cached content even after purge attempts.  
- Direct blob link proves storage is updated.  
- Likely cause: **AFD cache retention due to missing headers or propagation delay.**

---

## ðŸš§ Next Steps

1. Add a Rules Engine rule:  
   - Condition: `Request URL ends with .html`  
   - Action: Set response header â†’ `Cache-Control: no-store`
2. Redeploy and purge again.
3. If still unresolved, disable caching temporarily to confirm Front Door as the root cause.
4. Document outcome.
